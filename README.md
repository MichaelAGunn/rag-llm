# rag-llm
End-to-end large language model with retrievement augmentation, for your pleasure.
Loosely based on the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcqEUSNCn8I

## Project Plan
### Data Collection
The RAG components come from an Obsidian vault (i.e. my private Beloved repository).
The project should be able to work with any Obsidian vault.
### Notebooks
The exploratory plan is presented in a jupyter notebook format for easy presentation.
- Cookie Cutter
- Start Learning
- DS MLE
- DS MLE saved to .csv
### Deployment
This model is first deployed to a local LLM. This requires LLM studio to be running with a viable endpoint, or an equivalent API.
### Marketing & UX
This project is meant to be viewable and consumable by anyone with an Obsidian vault that they want to connect to a RAG LLM.
